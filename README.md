Generate random text with Express and Node
Combine knowledge of Node and Express to make a simple web application.

Read The Art of Node up through "Modules and npm."

Install the Node package lorem-ipsum via npm. This package generates "lorem ipsum" text, which is often used as filler for content that is not yet written.

Create an Express app that responds on the URL /lorem by returning three paragraphs of text in HTML format generated by the lorem-ipsum package.

Hard Mode  

Add the ability to accept URLs with the structure /lorem/[number-of-paragraphs], where [number-of-paragraphs] is a positive integer that determines how many paragraphs of lorem ipsum text to generate.
